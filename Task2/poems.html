						<p>It was many and many a year ago. <br>
							In a kingdom by the sea, <br>
							That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br>
							By the name of ANNABEL LEE: <br>
							And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
							Than to love and be loved by me. <br>
						 </p>
				 
						 <p>I was a child and she was a child, <br>
							In this kingdom by the sea: <br>
							But we loved with a love that was more than love -- <br>
							I and my ANNABEL LEE; <br>
							With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven <br>
							Coveted her and me. <br>
						 </p> 
						 <p>And this was the reason that, long ago, <br>
							In this kingdom by the sea, <br>
							A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br>
							My beautiful ANNABEL LEE; <br>
							So that her high kinsman came <br>
							And bore her away from me, <br>
							To shut her up in a sepulchre <br>
							In this kingdom by the sea. <br>
						 </p> 
						 <p>
						 	The angels, not half so happy in heaven. <br>
							Went envying her and me -- <br>
							Yes! -- that was the reason (as all men know <br>
							In this kingdom by the sea) <br>
							That this wind came out of the cloud by night, <br>
							Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE. <br>
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 	But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br>
							Of those who were older than we -- <br>
							Of many far wiser than we -- <br>
							And neither the angels in heaven above, <br>
							Nor the demons down under the sea, <br>
							Can ever dissever mv soul from the soul <br>
							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE. <br>
						 </p>
						 <p>
						 	For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>
							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE; <br>
							And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes <br>
							Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE: <br>
							And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side <br>
							Of my darling -- my darling -- my life and my bride, <br>
							In the sepulchre there by the sea, <br>
							In the tomb by the sounding sea. <br>
